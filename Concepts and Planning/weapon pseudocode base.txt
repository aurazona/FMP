Something along the lines of

If mouse clicked & firedelay[weapon] == 0 & bulletmag !=0

Cast ray/fire bullet
bulletmag--
firedelay++

If firedelay !=0

If firedelay !=120
Firedelay++
If firedelay == 120
Firedelay = 0
If R is pressed and bulletmag != maxmag
	Play reload animation
	Bulletmag == maxmag

If switchingweapon = true
	Firedelay = 0 (UNLESS ITâ€™S RAILGUN, IN WHICH CASE WEAPON SWITCHING IS DISABLED UNTIL IT IS READY TO FIRE AGAIN.)
